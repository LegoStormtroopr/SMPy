<h2>Purpose of study</h2>
<p>In this research, we are investigating how speakers choose between different words and phrases.
The information collected in this study will be used in the preparation of papers for presentation
in international conferences and journals on phonology and morphology.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>In this study, two phrases will be simultaneously presented on the screen. You will be asked to choose between the two different phrases, and to indicate your choice by pressing a key on the computer keyboard.</p>

<p>The entire process will last less than 20 minutes.</p>

<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>There are no known risks involved in this experimental procedure.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>There are no immediate benefits of this research. In the long term, however, this research may
help in the design of effective methods for language instruction and treatment of phonological
disorders.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Before starting the experiment, you will be asked to provide some biographical information, such as age, city, and native language. You may only take the experiment if you are at least 18 years old.</p>
