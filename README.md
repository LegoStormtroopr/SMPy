SurveyMan
=====
SurveyMan is an offshoot of the [Automan] (https://github.com/plasma-umass/AutoMan) project. Like Automan, SurveyMan automates human computation tasks. Unlike Automan, SurveyMan amortizes the cost of multiple human intelligence tasks by submitting tasks in groups. These groups resemble a survey, hence the name.
